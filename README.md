* Create a new folder with the name of your component <br> eg. If you are creating a Navbar Component then name your folder ```Navbar``` 
* Add the html, css, js files in that folder (Don't add your component code to the index.html) <br> eg. If you are creating a Navbar then name your files ```Navbar.html, Navbar.js, Navbar.css```
* Link the html file of your component to the link on the card created at [index.html](https://github.com/PCCoE-Hacktoberfest-21/animated-components/blob/main/index.html) file.
* Create a new card for every new component that you make.

* Please take a look at the [sample component](https://github.com/PCCoE-Hacktoberfest-21/animated-components/tree/main/Sample) to understand the folder structure better.
* You can contribute to as many components as you like. <b>You can add cool animated components of your own by creating an issue!</b>

### Folder Structure
1. Create a new folder with the name of your component
2. Add your files to your newly created folder with the proper naming convention as specified above
3. In the [index.html](https://github.com/PCCoE-Hacktoberfest-21/animated-components/blob/main/index.html) file add a comment stating your component name
4. Below the comment create a new card. The code for the card is as below: <br>
```
<!--     Sample Component (Replace the name with your component name  -->

      <div class="card" style="width: 18rem;">
        <div class="card-body">
          <h5 class="card-title text-dark">Name of your component</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Add information about your navbar with contributors name.</p>
          <a href="/animated-components/YOUR-FOLDER-NAME/YOUR-HTML-FILE.html" class="card-link text-warning"><strong>Demo</strong></a>
        </div>
      </div>
```
5. Make sure you add the above code to the main index.html file present in the root and NOT YOUR newly created html file.
6. <b><i> Please make sure you add the correct href to the card component. Use the format given below. </i></b>
  ```
   href="/animated-components/YOUR-FOLDER-NAME/YOUR-HTML-FILE.html"
